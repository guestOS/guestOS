Generally we are trying to stick with the [C4](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process (sorry for it's formalism) with some exceptions:

*  You may contribute non-trivial code from other projects (while not being an original author of that code) as long as that code's license is compatible with project's license (e.g. Public Domain, MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0 or MPL 2.0 itself). Please include a link to the original code in a comment (and preferably identify the licence). Also please indentify the authors (copyright holders) of the original code in the [contributors list](/AUTHORS) with a reference as to where their code was used, if the license requires an attribution.
